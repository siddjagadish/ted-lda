This repository contains scrits useful for analyzing the rhetoric of TED talks, by first downloading the subtitle (.srt) files for ~1600 TED talks, extracting desired text (at the level of an entire talk or a more granular level, such as only including certain parts of speech or treating different parts of a talk as separate documents), and then converting the data to a format usable by David Blei's LDA-C implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
